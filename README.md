## Appendix

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/ja/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

It will be simpler and faster to have the data locally, referring to the following.
However, since I try out this implementation in React18 that includes Ajax, I have taken the current structure that uses pokeapi.

- [pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json).
- [pokemon_data.json ja](https://github.com/kotofurumiya/pokemon_data).
